**UI Design Inspiration üé®**

The user interface (UI) design of the Car Shop App is based on the fantastic eCommerce App UI prototype available on Figma. A special thanks to the designers of this prototype for providing a creative and visually appealing foundation for the project.

[Figma eCommerce App UI Prototype](https://www.figma.com/file/sKeOTX5kgpCun5tfnYY6to/eCommerce-App-UI-(Free)-(Community)?type=design&node-id=15-339&mode=design&t=Bv185Id3l8jg5xCP-0)

While the overall structure and layout have been influenced by the prototype, I've customized and adapted the design to suit the specific needs and functionalities of the Car Shop App. This prototype served as a valuable reference, contributing to the aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly interface of the application.

Thank you to the Figma community for providing resources that inspire and facilitate the creative process.
